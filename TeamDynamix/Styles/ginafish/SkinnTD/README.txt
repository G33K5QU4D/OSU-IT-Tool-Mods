This style will "trim down" your TD pages for a "Skinny TeamDynamix" (yeah 
couldn't resist the puns...).  Namely: make the forms not force you to scroll 
all the time to set fields when editing tickets.  Like seriously, having to 
scroll to set the *STATUS* field is an incredibly poor design choice, as that 
is something that needs to be set on every ticket.


I also have a few more tweaks, like making the Status field be the first field 
in the forms.  There are options that will remove fields that are rarely used 
that are commented, and you can uncomment for use.  I have comments for each part 
that explains what it does.
I add a "suggested" preset for the field hiding if requested, but otherwise 
assuming that it's not something worth adding.
