# LBLE
Provides a set of CSS customization for multiple sites that OSU IT services use

The original design for most of these sites is very black and white.  

These styles provide a darker, warmer environment to the site. 

Currently these CSS files are only tested and applied with the Chrome extension known as Stylish.
