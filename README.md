### What:
This repo provides a set of user styles (note: only supported use with Stylish add-on) for multiple sites
that OSU IT services use, as well as a few user scripts (note: only supported use with Tampermonkey add-on).
Basically, our in-house written "themes" for the tools we use at
the OSU Service Desk under Information Services.

### Why:
The original design for most of these sites is very white and
required a decent amount of scrolling in some cases.  These 
styles and scripts, developed by OSU IT employees, provide 
a better looking and more functional environment to the sites.
