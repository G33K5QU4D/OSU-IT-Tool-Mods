This repo provides a set of user styles* for multiple sites
that OSU IT services use, as well as a few user scripts.

The original design for most of these sites is very white and
required a decent amount of scrolling in some cases.  These 
styles and scripts, developed by OSU IT employees, provide 
a better looking and more functional environment to the sites.
